                                taken aback obviously but didn't let it overwhelm me as I immediately realised
                                this represented a turning point in our quest to finally crack the Roman Numeral
                                code!</em></p>
                        <p><em>Looking back I'm not sure how but I managed to stay calm and focussed-in on what
                                needed to be done so I called for an emergency
                                session of TR Hi-Tech Council in the Square Office and shortly the team
                                had assembled and entered into hot debate as to the explanantion of this
                                <strong>strange
                                    phenomenon</strong> and if

                                many arguments to be fair and so we continued
